# Weave for Mac
### This is my SwiftUI, JavaScript, and CSS experimenting playground, partially made with ChatGPT. Don't seriously use this as your main browser.

*But, while we're here...*

## Features:

Built for macOS, with features like toolbar customization, native tabbing, Share Sheet support, and SF Symbols

Brings the macOS world into your browser, with translucency effects, the San Francisco font, and your accent color automatically integrated across a wide range of websites

Favicon and page title loading support

Adblocking built directly in

Fully WebKit based, extremely lightweight and efficient

## Information:

**REQUIRES** an Intel or Apple Silicon Mac running macOS Monterey or later

Built with Xcode 15, SwiftUI, WebKit, and of course, made (kinda) with ChatGPT.

## What's next?

Additional theming and styling enhancements (potentially a custom dark mode implementation, or more accent based theming)

Selecting all text upon focusing address bar

Fixing permissions

Potentially a home button

A clear cache/cookies/data button (near future honestly)

File download support

Maybe some commands to enter into the address bar, for easter eggs and functional reasons...

## Wish list (No clue if it's coming or not)

Better tabbing support

Settings menu with customization for custom CSS/JS and page translucency

Alternative app icons

Automatic shortening of URLs in address bar when not being edited (Shockingly hard.)

Pinch to zoom

Trackpad gestures

Touch Bar support

Support to build web applications directly from Weave! (May end up as a spinoff project)
